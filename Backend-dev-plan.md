# 1) Executive Summary
This document outlines the development plan for the UpLearn LMS backend. The backend will be built using **Node.js with the Express framework** and will use **MongoDB Atlas** as its database. This plan honors the constraints specified in the prompt, including a `main`-only Git workflow and frontend-driven manual testing.

The sprint count is dynamic and has been designed to cover all features currently visible in the frontend application, ensuring a complete and functional backend that integrates seamlessly with the existing UI.

# 2) In-scope & Success Criteria
- **In-scope Features**:
  - User authentication (signup, login, logout) with JWT.
  - Role-based access control for students, instructors, and admins.
  - Full course management (create, read, update, delete) for instructors.
  - Course enrollment and progress tracking for students.
  - User and course administration for admins.
  - Certificate generation upon course completion.
  - Payment integration (conceptual, with Stripe as the example).
  - Analytics for instructors and platform-wide analytics for admins.

- **Success Criteria**:
  - All frontend features are fully supported by the backend APIs.
  - Each development sprint concludes with successful manual testing conducted through the frontend UI.
  - The application is stable, secure, and ready for deployment.
  - Code is successfully pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub after each sprint's validation.

# 3) API Design
- **Conventions**:
  - API Base Path: `/api`

  - Flow: Frontend initiates payment -> Backend creates a Stripe Payment Intent -> Frontend confirms payment -> Backend verifies via webhook.
  - Env Vars: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`.

# 8) Testing Strategy (Manual via Frontend)
- **Policy**: All backend features will be validated by interacting with the connected frontend application. The browser's Network tab in DevTools will be used to inspect API requests and responses.
- **Process**: After each sprint, the developer will perform the tests outlined in the sprint's "Manual Test Checklist". If all tests pass, the code will be committed and pushed to the `main` branch.

# 9) Dynamic Sprint Plan & Backlog (S0â€¦S4)

### S0 - Environment Setup & Frontend Connection

  - Create a basic Node.js/Express server skeleton.
  - Set up MongoDB connection using Mongoose.
  - Implement a `/api/healthz` endpoint that checks DB connectivity.

  - The frontend can successfully make a request to the backend.
  - The initial project structure is on GitHub.
- **Manual Test Checklist (Frontend)**:
  - 1. Start the backend server.
  - 2. Start the frontend development server.
  - 3. In the frontend code, make a test call to `/api/healthz` (e.g., in `App.tsx`'s `useEffect`).
  - 4. Open the browser console and Network tab to confirm a successful `200 OK` response.
- **User Test Prompt**: "Verify the application loads and the browser console shows a 'Backend connection successful' message."
- **Post-sprint**: Commit changes and push to `main`.

### S1 - Basic Auth (Signup, Login, Logout)
